# This website!

This website was made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator in Ruby. Its hosted with Github pages and was (or is) a really cool way to learn a little more about the hole website building thing. I had to do many little modifications to the original theme, it can be annoying when things don't go right, but When they do, it's a really cool experience. [You can see the sites repository here](https://github.com/rodrigosousaeoliveira/mypage).
