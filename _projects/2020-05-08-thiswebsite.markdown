A really fast and (mostly) fun way to learn a little about website building.

This website was made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator in Ruby. It's hosted with Github pages and was (or is) a really cool way to learn a little more about the hole website building thing. I had to do many little modifications to the original theme, it can be annoying when things don't go right, but when they do, it's a really cool experience. [You can see the sites repository here](https://github.com/rodrigosousaeoliveira/mypage).

I also got to write some [sass/css](https://sass-lang.com/) and html, which is something I had not done in some time. It was nice to try and remember some names and concepts!
