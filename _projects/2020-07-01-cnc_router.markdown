title: 'CNC ROUTER: 1000mm x 1500mm Aluminium Frame'
description: Probably the coolest project yet

---

I was an intern at Metrum Equipamentos de Medição e Testes Ltda for 15 months and the biggest project I developed there (and the one I am the most proud of) was this beautiful CNC Router. I had great guidance from Kayran, an engineer who unfortunately passed away during the project. 

I made the entire CAD assembly using Autodesk Inventor, which looked a lot like Solidworks. The router uses aluminium extrusions (30 x 60 and 30 x 30) and 1/4 inch thick aluminium plates for structure, which makes it really stiff. For the movement, the NEMA23 motors spin a 12mm trapezoidal screws. The bed is MDF and every once in a while we would use a facing bit to make it flat. It worked really well. Although it is a big machine, I was able to mill some very good PCBs and some aluminium plates.
