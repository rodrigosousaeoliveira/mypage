## Welcome to my page!

This is the page I created to be my resumé/portfolio/blog and a general repository for my projects and any funny interests I might wanna share!

### Who am I?

I am a maker/tinkerer and overall STEM enthusiast who also happens to be absolutely fascinated with airplanes and other flying things. I've done some really cool and exciting projects over the years and you can check them out [here](). I also love music: I play the trombone and the guitar and will talk a lot about it if you mention it.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rodrigosousaeoliveira/rodrigo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
