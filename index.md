# Welcome to my page!

This is the page I created to be my resumé/portfolio/blog and a general repository for my projects and any interesting theme I might wanna share!

## About me

I am a maker/tinkerer and overall STEM enthusiast who also happens to be fascinated with airplanes and other flying things. I've done some really cool and exciting projects over the years and you can check them out [here](). I also love music: I play the trombone and the guitar and will talk a lot about it if I get the chance.
